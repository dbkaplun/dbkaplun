Hey guys, I&#39;m a full stack web developer who loves working with open source technology.

## Work

  * Manage a large 300gb Mongo DB

  Worked on many politically charged campaigns against mass surveillance. Our latest project was &quot;TheDayWeFightBack&quot; and I worked on all areas of it. The campaign resulted in 37,000,000 banner views, 100,000 phone calls, ~500,000 emails and ~250,000 signatures. I work mostly in the frontend and also running the Heroku servers which are cached by Cloudfront.
